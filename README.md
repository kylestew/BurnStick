# BurnStick

TODO:
+ Figure out how to wire up level shifter
+ Bring 64 LED grid online
+ Bring FFT online with basic audio response
+ Prototype some animations

Notes:
+ Aim for a 1m distance between power connections - you can wire power supply anywhere in the strand
+ Need a logic level shifter for 3.3 to 5V levels if you want high output LEDs
+ To bridge pixels to controller, match grounds but not VCC levels
